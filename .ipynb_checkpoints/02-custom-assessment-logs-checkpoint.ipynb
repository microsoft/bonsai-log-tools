    "This notebook offers you a template to import your Bonsai custom assessment data into Jupyter. When you run a custom assessment, the assessment data will be automatically logged to your Log Analytics Workspace (LAW). Simply add your Log Analytics Workspace ID, your email alias, and the brain name, brain version, and assessment name for the assessment data that you're interested in. Then, run the notebook. The final output will be two different data frames with your custom assessment data, each of which have different formats as described at the bottom of this notebook.\n",

This is a one-time step per subscription and the user will need owner-level permission. If you don't have the appropriate permission, work with your IT admin to execute that step.\n",
